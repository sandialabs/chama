Optimization
============

The :mod:`chama.optimize` module contains **P-median** and **coverage** sensor
placement optimization. Additional methods could be added to this
module. 

P-median
--------

The P-median formulation is used to determine optimal sensor
placement and type that minimizes impact, where impact can be detection time or 
some other measure of damage.
The P-median formulation is written in Pyomo [HLWW12]_ and solved
using an open source or commercial MIP solver such as GLPK [Makh10]_,
Gurobi [GUROBI]_, or CPLEX [CPLEX]_.
The open source GLPK solver is used by default. The P-median sensor
placement formulation is described below:

.. math::
   
    \text{minimize} \qquad &\sum_{a \in A} \alpha_a \sum_{i \in {\cal L}_a}
    d_{ai} x_{ai}\\
	\text{subject to} \qquad &\sum_{i\in {\cal L}_a} x_{ai} = 1 \hspace{1.2in}
    \forall a \in A\\
	&x_{ai} \le s_i       \hspace{1.47in}  \forall a \in A, i \in {\cal L}_a\\
	&\sum_{i \in L} c_i s_i \le p\\ 
	&s_i \in \{0,1\}      \hspace{1.3in}      \forall i \in L\\ 
	&0 \leq x_{ai} \leq 1 \hspace{1.23in}      \forall a \in A, i \in {\cal L}_a 

where:

* :math:`A` is the set of all scenarios

* :math:`L` is the set of all candidate sensors

* :math:`{\cal L_a}` is the set of all sensors that are capable of detecting
  scenario :math:`a`

* :math:`\alpha_a` is the probability of occurrence for scenario :math:`a`

* :math:`d_{ai}` is the impact coefficient, and represents some measure
  of the impact that will be incurred if scenario :math:`a` is first
  detected by sensor :math:`i`

* :math:`x_{ai}` is an indicator variable that will be 1 if sensor
  :math:`i` is installed and that sensor is the first to detect scenario
  :math:`a` (where `first` is defined as the minimum possible impact,
  usually defined as time to detection)

* :math:`s_i` is a binary variable that will be 1 if sensor :math:`i` is
  selected, and 0 otherwise

* :math:`c_i` is the cost of sensor :math:`i` 

* :math:`p` is the sensors budget

The size of the optimization problem is determined by the number of
binary variables.  Although :math:`x_{ai}` is a binary indicator
variable, it is relaxed to be continuous between 0 and 1, and yet it
always converges to a value of 0 or 1. Therefore, the number of binary
variables that need to be considered by the solver is a function of the
number of candidate sensors alone, and not the number of scenarios
considered.  This formulation has been used to place sensors in large
water distribution networks [BHPU06]_ [USEPA12]_ [USEPA15]_ and for gas
detection in petrochemical facilities [LBSW12]_.

The user supplies the impact assessment, :math:`d_{ai}`, sensor budget,
:math:`p`, and (optionally) sensor cost, :math:`c_i` and the
scenario probability, :math:`\alpha_a`, as described below:

* Impact assessment: A single detection time (or other measure of damage) for 
  each sensor that detects a scenario.  Impact is stored as a Pandas DataFrame, 
  as described in the :ref:`impact` section.  
  
* Sensor budget: The number of sensors to place, or total budget for sensors.
  If the 'use_sensor_cost' flag is True, the sensor budget is a dollar amount
  and the optimization uses the cost of individual sensors.  If the
  'use_sensor_cost' flag is False (default), the sensor budget is a number of
  sensors and the optimization does not use sensor cost.

* Sensor characteristics: Sensor characteristics include the cost of each
  sensor. Sensor characteristics are stored as a Pandas DataFrame with columns
  'Sensor' and 'Cost'. Cost is used in the sensor placement optimization if the
  'use_sensor_cost' flag is set to True.
  
* Scenario characteristics: Scenario characteristics include scenario
  probability and the impact for undetected scenarios. Scenario characteristics
  are stored as a Pandas DataFrame with columns 'Scenario', 'Undetected Impact'
  , and 'Probability'. Undetected Impact is required for each scenario. When
  minimizing detection time, the undetected impact value can be set to a value
  larger than time horizon used for the study. Individual scenarios can also be
  given different undetected impact values. Probability is used if the
  'use_scenario_probability' flag is set to True.
  
Results are stored in a dictionary with the following information:

* Sensors: A list of selected sensors

* Objective: The expected (mean) impact based on the selected sensors

* Assessment: The impact value for each sensor-scenario pair.
  The assessment is stored as a Pandas DataFrame with columns 'Scenario', 'Sensor', and 
  'Impact' (same format as the input Impact assessment')
  If the selected sensors did not detect a particular scenario, the impact is set to 
  the Undetected Impact.
  
The following example demonstrates the use of P-median sensor placement:

    ...                           'Detection Times': [[2, 3, 4], [3], [4, 5, 6, 7]]})

    ...                              'Impact': [2.0,3.0,4.0]})

    >>> print(results['Sensors'])
    ['A']
    >>> print(results['Objective'])

    >>> print(results['Assessment'])
      Scenario Sensor  Impact

Coverage
--------

Sensors can also be placed to maximize coverage.  Coverage uses the P-median
formulation and translates the impact assessment internally. The
'use_sensor_cost' and 'use_scenario_probability' flags can be used with
coverage. The user can also select if sensors are placed to maximize
scenario coverage or time coverage using the 'coverage_type' flag (set to
'scenario' or 'time').

Data requirements for coverage are the same as data requirements for the
P-median formulation with the following exceptions:

* If 'coverage_type' is set to 'time', then the impact assessment must be a
  list of detection times for each sensor that detects a scenario.

* Undetected Impact is not required for each scenario.

The following example demonstrates the use of time coverage sensor placement.
The results list scenario-time pairs that were detected by the sensor
placement (listed as a (time, scenario) tuple).  The impact value is 1 if
the scenario-time pair was detected, and 0 otherwise.

    The following test checks a subset of the results in the SensorAssessment
    and the EntityAssessment dictionaries. These cannot be tested using the
    above print statements because of Python 2/3 compatibility issues and
    non-deterministic dictionary ordering.
